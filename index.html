        <p class="para">Sri Sagi Ramakrishnam Raju, the doyen of contractors, was the founder of Prasad & Company (Project Works) Limited. He has played a philanthropic role in the construction of Nagarjuna Sagar Dam, the world's largest, highest Masonary Dam in Andhra Pradesh. In the execution of this project work, he was constantly troubled by the lack of quality engineers. The sudden innovative idea to meet the needs of the then society & flourish it by leaps of bounds, his vision came into the limelight in the form of a prestigious institution named S.R.K.R. Engineering College in the rural background. Discussions with the elite of the town nourished the formation of an educational society in the name of "Sagi Ramakrishnam Raju Engineering College Association". Sri Sagi Ramakrishnam Raju, a visionary driven by the conviction that the country's progress and prosperity are invariably linked to the fostering human excellence in the sphere of science and technology, came forward with a magnanimous donation for the establishment of this college. The college was established on 22-10-1980 and is named after him "Sagi Ramakrishnam Raju Engineering College" in recognition of his services.</p>

    <h1 class="TandPProfile">T&P Profile:</h1>    
    <p>SRKR Training & Placement Department, formerly known as T&P Cell, was established in 1995 with a main objective of creating ample career opportunities for students in reputed Corporate Companies. A separate Training &Placement Department is existing in the college and Sri. K.R.Satyanarayana is leading the department as Dean.</p>

    <p>The Training and Placement Department of SRKREC holds a dominant position shouldering various responsibilities and running a gamut of activities intended to cater to the needs of the students. The department plays a pivotal role in locating jobs for UG and PG students by being constantly in touch with the reputed firms and industrial establishments. Equipping the students with the required technical, quantitative, verbal and behavioral skills for placements and also assisting them in terms of future academic prospects, the department relentlessly strives to channel their creative energies into what they aspire for i.e., either a professional or a researcher.</p>
        
    <p> We’ve been consistently successful in maintaining high placement statistics over the years and the fact that our students bear the recession blues with impressive placements demonstrates the efficacy of the training by the on-campus as well as off-campus trainers. Our Alumni rose to be top-notch professionals setting new standards in various establishments throughout the world and it is the firm conviction of the department to do much better in the years to come. The department, with chief concentration on making the students industry-ready, offers the course titled ‘Verbal and Quantitative Aptitude’ and also another paper titled ‘Basic Coding’ in one semester and ‘Advanced Coding’ in the other on coding skills all of which are credit courses for III year students for both the semesters, and ‘English Proficiency’ for II year students in order for an overall development of skills essential for a job-seeker.</p>
